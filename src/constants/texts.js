Sometimes, these actions will also alter the scene’s visuals. In the mixer, it's possible to create the perfect vibe by customizing the background music loop to your preference, choosing between a chill, jazzy or sleepy vibe and then mixing	it with the ambient noises. It's possible to save your favorite combination of art,	music and sounds as a template. The platforms also offers a suite of productivity tools,	which is set in its own customizable illustration and allows users to work/study insessions.";
